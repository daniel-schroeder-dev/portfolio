    <section id="about">
      <article class="about-me">
        <p>I’m a full-stack freelance web developer and educator. I discovered my love for programming in my late 20's, and have spent most of my time since then learning how to build things with code. Although I'm mostly self-taught, I have had help from a few college courses, bootcamps, and dozens of tutorials and books. I've worked with JavaScript, Ruby, Java, C, and PHP, in addition to HTML and CSS.</p> 
        <p>I’m interested in learning more about UI/UX design, and would love a chance to work closely with graphic designers on implementing amazing client experiences. I also really enjoy writing server-side code, and am hoping to pursue some dev-ops projects in the near future.</p>
        <p>I'm currently hard at work developing numerous personal projects as well as teaching the next generation of young developers over at <a href="https://codewizardshq.com/">CodeWizardsHQ</a>.</p>
        <p>Check out my <a href="#projects">projects</a> or head over to my <a href="https://github.com/daniel-schroeder-dev">GitHub</a> if you want to see some examples of my work, and feel free to <a href="#contact">contact</a> me if you'd like to work together or have an opportunity I may be interested in.</p>

        <p class="projects__description">I've probably built 100 todo list apps at this point, but it's always a good test of a new framework or concept to throw one together. In this case, I wanted to learn how to hook React up to an Express server with MongoDB as the data store, and a simple todo application was an easy test of my skills. I built it without a framework first <a href="https://ds-dev-todo-list.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.</p>

        <p class="projects__description">Another chance to try game programming in React. This one is NOT mobile friendly, just because there wasn't a good way to make the game playable on a mobile device.</p>

        <p class="projects__description">Hacker News has great content, but the presentation is a bit lacking. Besides working on some basic list-styling, I used this app to practice working with React Hooks, CSS Animations for the loading icon, and handling multiple async XHR requests to the Hacker News API.</p>

        <p class="projects__description">Another React app that I made to practice working with the React Router and making API calls. I also took some time to create a decent looking UI, although this one is NOT mobile friendly yet as the primary goal was learning the React material. I was using the jsonplaceholder API for the data originally, but it was having some issues so I wrote my own Express/MongoDB app to return dummy data at <a href="https://ds-jsonplaceholder-api.herokuapp.com/posts">jsonplaceholder-api</a>.</p>

        <p class="projects__description">While learning about React Router, I decided to dig into the History API and create a simple SPA using it. This project was the result. It's inspired by <a href="https://css-tricks.com/using-the-html5-history-api/">Using The HTML5 History API</a> from the great folks at <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks</a>, and my obsession with all things Star Wars.</p>

        <p class="projects__description">A quick project that I did to work on implementing a simple user profile card design. I decided to add a button that pulls data from the random user API so I could work with XHR requests. No frameworks, no fluff, just fun!</p>
