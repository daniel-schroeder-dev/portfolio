    <section id="about">
      <article class="about-me">
        <p>I’m a full-stack freelance web developer and educator. I discovered my love for programming in my late 20's, and have spent most of my time since then learning how to build things with code. Although I'm mostly self-taught, I have had help from a few college courses, bootcamps, and dozens of tutorials and books. I've worked with JavaScript, Ruby, Java, C, and PHP, in addition to HTML and CSS.</p> 
        <p>I’m interested in learning more about UI/UX design, and would love a chance to work closely with graphic designers on implementing amazing client experiences. I also really enjoy writing server-side code, and am hoping to pursue some dev-ops projects in the near future.</p>
        <p>Check out my <a href="#projects">Projects</a> or <a href="https://github.com/daniel-schroeder-dev">GitHub</a> if you want to see some examples of my work, and feel free to <a href="#contact">Contact</a> me if you'd like to work together.</p>

        <p class="projects__description">Hacker News has great content, but the presentation is a bit lacking. Besides working on some basic list-styling, I used this app to practice working with React Hooks, CSS Animations for the loading icon, and handling multiple XHR requests to the Hacker News API with Promise.all().</p>
