    <section id="about">
      <article class="about-me">
        <p>I’m a full-stack freelance web developer and educator. I discovered my love for programming in my late 20's, and have spent most of my time since then learning how to build things with code. Although I'm mostly self-taught, I have had help from a few college courses, bootcamps, and dozens of tutorials and books. I've worked with JavaScript, Ruby, Java, C, and PHP, in addition to HTML and CSS.</p> 
        <p>I’m interested in learning more about UI/UX design, and would love a chance to work closely with graphic designers on implementing amazing client experiences. I also really enjoy writing server-side code, and am hoping to pursue some dev-ops projects in the near future.</p>
        <p>Check out my <a href="#projects">Projects</a> or <a href="https://github.com/daniel-schroeder-dev">GitHub</a> if you want to see some examples of my work, and feel free to <a href="#contact">Contact</a> me if you'd like to work together.</p>

      <h3 class="projects-header__title">Recent Projects</h3>
      <p class="projects-header__description">Here's a few things I've been working on for the past 6 months. I keep this list curated with recent projects, mainly to keep me honest and building new things! Many are hosted on free Heroku dynos, so please be patient for the first page load as the servers sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity.</p>
      <article class="projects hacker-news">

        <h4 class="projects__title">Top 20 Articles from Hacker News</h4>
        <p class="projects__date">March, 2020</p>

        <p class="projects__description">Hacker News has great content, but the presentation is a bit lacking. Besides working on some basic list-styling, I used this app to practice working with React Hooks, CSS Animations for the loading icon, and handling multiple async XHR requests to the Hacker News API.</p>

        <p class="projects__description">While learning about React Router, I decided to dig into the History API and create a simple SPA using it. This project was the result. It's inspired by <a href="https://css-tricks.com/using-the-html5-history-api/">Using The HTML5 History API</a> from the great folks at <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks</a>, and my obsession with all things Star Wars.</p>
